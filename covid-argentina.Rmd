In the last post, we have analysed the current situation in Bolivia with regards to the damage caused by COVID-19. To do so, we used different formats of tables that allowed one to track the evolution of cases, deaths and much more. <br>

In the current post, we will keep exploring South-America, but now we will examine Argentina. The country is the second economy in the region, and the third larger population. With respect to COVID-19, more than 350.000 cases have been observed locally, and more than 7.000 people have lost their lifes. 

We will use different tools to build visualisations that allow one to understand the current situation of the country with respect to the evolution of the pandemic in the region during the year. Additionally, we will also explore the visually eventual differences of the spread of the virus according to geographical regions of the country. 

<br>

## The Dataset

As in the previous post, We are working with a dataset sourced from the website [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/bolivia?country=~BOL). The website is from the organization with the same name, based on Oxford University. 

We have downloaded the `owid-covid-data.csv` file, which has COVID information about more than 190 countries across the world. Since our analysis will focus exclusively on Argentina, we have filtered out all other countries from the table. <br>

The dataset is a multivariate time-series that comprises multiple features from the period of the 31th of December, 2019 to the 26th of August of 2020.
It has 40 columns with 36 features of every country. Some directly related to the Covid-19 such as the total number of deaths, total number of deaths per million habitats number of tests per day and positive rate of tests. Other data are social and economic variables that are indirectly related to covid-19 spread such as the median age of the population, GDP per capita, percentage of smokers and much more. <br>

<br>

## Visualisation 1 - Evolution of COVID-19 in Argentina 

In the following visualisations, we can observe the evolution of the number of cases and deaths of COVID-19 in Argentina across the year of 2020. The first recorded case in Argentina was in the 03-Apr-2020, after most countries in the world. <br>

In the following plots, for variables can be observed:
1. The number of new cases of Covid-19 in Argentina each day
2. The number of new deaths of Covid-19 in Argentina each day
3. The accumulated number of cases of Covid-19 in Argentina each day
3. The accumulated number of deaths of Covid-19 in Argentina each day

In the each plots there are two y-axis. The reason behind it is that there is a relevant difference in magnitude between the presented variables in each plot. 

In the plot on the left one can see the number of total cases of covid-19 x new cases in Argentina. In the plot on the right one can see the number of total deaths of covid-19 x new deaths. Acummulated variables are represented as lines while the bars represent new numbers.   


```{r interactive, echo=FALSE}

# read the data
data <- read.csv('owid-covid-data.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# filter Argentina
argentina_df <- data %>% 
  filter(location  == "Argentina")

# manipulate date
argentina_df$date <- seq(as.Date("2020-02-11"), by="1 day", length.out=198)

# Select columns and create new dataframes
col_cases <- c('date', 'new_cases', 'total_cases')
col_deaths <- c('date', 'new_deaths', 'total_deaths')
argentina_deaths <- argentina_df[col_deaths]
argentina_cases <- argentina_df[col_cases]

# data cleaning - change data types and remove NAs
argentina_deaths <- na.omit(argentina_deaths)
argentina_cases <- na.omit(argentina_cases)
argentina_deaths$new_deaths <- as.numeric(argentina_deaths$new_deaths)
argentina_deaths$total_deaths <- as.numeric(argentina_deaths$total_deaths)
argentina_cases$new_cases <- as.numeric(argentina_cases$new_cases)
argentina_cases$total_cases <- as.numeric(argentina_cases$total_cases)

# Change Names of Columns
colnames(argentina_cases) <- c('Date', 'New_Cases', 'Total_Cases')
colnames(argentina_deaths) <- c('Date', 'New_Deaths', 'Total_Deaths')

Some notes about an attentive observation of the table are the following:<br>
* The number of cases and deaths follow extremely similar patterns, as expected.
* The pandemic has not gone through the pic yet in Argentina. The country is still experimenting a growth trend.
* Observing rough numbers, the mortality rate in Argentina is about 2%. There have been ~ 7.5 thousand deaths and 300 thousand cases.

## Table 2 - Analysis of Cases per Region 

Now, we will dive in the statistics of the new cases of Covid-19 in Bolivia. We will make this analysis by each month. We will how was the distribution of the number of new cases every month, the dispersion, the mean, median and so on.

The central points one can observe in the table are the following:

1. There is a crystal clear trend of increase in the number of new cases every month. <br>
2. Nevertheless, the month of August has recorded a smaller amount of cases than the others, which indicated the pic was in the previous month. <br>    
3. As the number of cases increases every month, so does the dispersion of the data. It can be observed in the boxplots.

# make the polygons a bit less verbose
