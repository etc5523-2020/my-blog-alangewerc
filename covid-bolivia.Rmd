Most countries in the world were severely affected by COVID-19. Death, hardship and poverty are a few of the consequences observed in most regions. In Latin-America, unfortunately, COVID-19 was no exception. The continent is experiencing big suffering as consequence of the pandemic. The region is already one of the poorest in the world and has a significant housing deficit. Under this circumstances, families are obliged to live together in small homes making the region a potential hotspot for the virus spread.  

Our analysis in this post will be focused in Bolivia which is suffering the consequences of COVID-19 as every country. Nevertheless, compared to its neighbors in Latin-America Bolivia is achieving superior results handling the spread of the virus. 

While countries like Brazil and Peru had in the end of August a total of `17265.738` and `18421.231` cases per million of habitats respectively, Bolivia `9509.014`. The government implemented sequential lockdowns over the year that apparently were able to contain `flatten the curve`. 

<br>

## The Dataset

The dataset was sourced from the website [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/bolivia?country=~BOL). The website is from the organization with the same name, based on Oxford University. It has a research team focused on providing high quality open-source data for the scientific community across the world to tackle challenging problems such as pandemic.  

We have downloaded the `owid-covid-data.csv` file, which has COVID information about more than 190 countries across the world. Since our analysis will focus exclusively on Bolivia, we have filtered out all other countries from the table. <br>

The dataset is a multivariate time-series that comprises multiple features from the period of the 31th of December, 2019 to the 26th of August of 2020.
It has 40 columns with 36 features of every country. Some directly related to the Covid-19 such as the total number of deaths, total number of deaths per million habitats number of tests per day and positive rate of tests. Other data are social and economic variables that are indirectly related to covid-19 spread such as the median age of the population, GDP per capita, percentage of smokers and much more. <br>

Given our restrictions of time and resources, unfortunately we will work only with a fraction of the data, tat will allow us to understand the spread of the virus in Bolivia.  

<br>

## Table 1 - Covid Data from Bolivia 

In the following table one can observe the evolution of the total number of cases and deaths of COVID-19 in Bolivia across the year of 2020. The first recorded case in Bolivia was in the 21-Mar-2020, long after most countries in the world. <br>

The table is not in absolute numbers but in relative ones. All cases and deaths are in a 1:million hab. scale. This scale makes it easy to compare different countries that different populations. 

The table is interactive, so one can choose different ranges of data from the table. <br>

We are exposing in the table the number of new daily cases and deaths, but also accumulated numbers. Additionally, in the table we can see the number of tests and the positive rate. 




```{r interactive, , echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv('owid-covid-data.csv')
bolivia_df <- data %>% 
  filter(location  == "Bolivia")

bolivia_df <- data %>% 
  filter(location  == "Bolivia")

bolivia_df$date <- as.Date(bolivia_df$date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
bolivia_df$date <- format(bolivia_df$date, "%Y-%b-%d")


cols <- c('date', 'new_cases_per_million', 'new_deaths_per_million', 'total_cases_per_million', 'total_deaths_per_million', 'total_tests_per_thousand',
          'positive_rate')


bolivia_df <- bolivia_df[cols]
bolivia_df <- na.omit(bolivia_df)

colnames(bolivia_df) <- c('Date', 'New Cases / Million Hab.', 'New Deaths / Million Hab.', 'Total Cases / Million Hab.', 'Total Deaths / Million Hab.',
                          'New Tests per Thousand', 'Positive Rate')


datatable(bolivia_df, filter = 'top', options = list(
  pageLength = 5, autoWidth = TRUE))

```

<br>

Some notes about an attentive observation of the table are the following:<br>
* The number of cases has increased sharply over days and months and it has gone through the pic recently. <br>
* The number of tests has increased as well, which is something positive, as we know testing is a key strategy to fight the virus. <br>
* The number of positive rates has also increased over the year, which might be associated with more accurate tests or an increase in the number of cases.



<br>

## Table 2 - Statistical Analysis - Covid Data from Bolivia 

Now, we will dive in the statistics of the new cases of Covid-19 in Bolivia. We will make this analysis by each month. We will how was the distribution of the number of new cases every month, the dispersion, the mean, median and so on.

The central points one can observe in the table are the following:

1. There is a crystal clear trend of increase in the number of new cases every month. <br>
2. Nevertheless, the month of August has recorded a smaller amount of cases than the others, which indicated the pic was in the previous month. <br>    
3. As the number of cases increases every month, so does the dispersion of the data. It can be observed in the boxplots.  


```{r test , results='asis', echo=FALSE}

data <- read.csv('owid-covid-data.csv')

bolivia_df <- data %>% 
  filter(location  == "Bolivia")

cols <- c('date', 'new_cases_per_million')

bolivia_df <- bolivia_df[cols]

bolivia_df <- na.omit(bolivia_df)

bolivia_df$date <- as.Date(bolivia_df$date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
bolivia_df$date <- as.Date(bolivia_df$date, format="%B %d %Y")


bolivia_df$date <- months(bolivia_df$date)
date_list <- split(bolivia_df$new_cases_per_million, bolivia_df$date)
date_list <- list(date_list$March, date_list$April ,date_list$May,
                  date_list$June ,date_list$July, date_list$August)

bolivia_df %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarise(Total  = round(sum(new_cases_per_million),2),
            Average = round(mean(new_cases_per_million),2),
            Median = round(median(new_cases_per_million),2),
            Max = round(max(new_cases_per_million),2),
            Minimum = round(min(new_cases_per_million),2),
            Stand.Dev. = round(sd(new_cases_per_million),2),
            Boxplot = '',
            Histogram = '',
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  arrange(Median) %>%
  kbl(booktabs = T) %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(8, image = spec_boxplot(date_list)) %>%
  column_spec(9, image = spec_hist(date_list))


```
